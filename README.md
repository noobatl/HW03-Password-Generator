# HW03-Password-Generator

## Description

As an employee with access to sensitive data, I wanted to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria so that I can create a strong password that provides greater security. The Password Generator is designed to construct a password between 8 characters and 128 characters long, using the criteria the user designates. When you click the "Generate Password" button, the user has the ability to decide how long the password should be, as well as, what characters to include in the password. Character choices include: lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. We have given the user the ability to choose how large or small, and what contents make up the password. Let's say the system that the password is being generated for does not allow symbols, the user has the ability to make a password with only numbers, lowercase and uppercase letters. Once we figure out how to write all the random letters, numbers and symbols in the length decided by the user, the Password Generator will work seemlessly. 

The following image demonstrates the application functionality:
